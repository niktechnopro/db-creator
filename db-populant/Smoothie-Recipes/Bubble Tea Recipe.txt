Ingredients: 
Ingredient: 1.0 cup large tapioca pearls
Ingredient: 1.0 cup milk
Ingredient: 1.0 cup chai tea mix
Ingredient: 2.0 cups ice
Ingredient: 3.0 tablespoons honey, or to taste
Directions: 
Duration: 5 m
Step: Fill a saucepan about halfway with water, and bring to a boil. Add the tapioca pearls, and return to a boil. Stir to make sure they do not start to stick together or to the pot. Cover, and simmer over medium heat for 45 minutes. Remove from the heat and let stand for 30 minutes, then rinse and drain. The pearls should be squishy and black. Stir some of the honey into the pearls so they are coated.
Step: Place the milk, any remaining honey, tea mix, and ice into the container of a blender. Cover, and blend to your desired slushiness. Pour the tea into two large glasses. Spoon half of the tapioca pearls into each glass. If you can find extra wide straws, place one into each drink to suck up the pearls and chew on them while you are drinking.
